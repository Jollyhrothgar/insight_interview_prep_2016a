# Introduction  

This repository contains materials I generated as part of my preparations for interviews in insight data science!

Within this repository, I have ranked the study topics, and will create python notebooks or links to solutions, and further study.

Topics (overall) will be rated with a score (1, 2, or 3), where 3 is "very prepared", 2 is "familiar, needs study" and 3 is "not at all prepared".
